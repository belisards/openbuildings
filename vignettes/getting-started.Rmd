# Introduction

`MyPackage` is designed to help users download and analyze building data from Google Open Buildings and OpenStreetMap. This vignette demonstrates the basic usage of the package functions.

# Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("belisards/openbuildings")

library(openbuildings)

bbox <- c(14.90546335395436, 4.275308778796507, 14.919215493755678, 4.283059290376294)


osm_buildings <- openbuildings::download_buildings(bbox,provider = "osm")

bing_buildings <- openbuildings::download_buildings(bbox,provider = "bing")


google_buildings <- openbuildings::download_buildings(bbox,provider = "google")

# Load the sf package for spatial data manipulation
library(sf)

# Filter buildings larger than a certain area
large_buildings <- google_buildings %>% 
  dplyr::filter(st_area(geometry) > 100)

# Display the first few rows of large buildings
print(head(large_buildings))
