Description: The package allows users to access building datasets from multiple providers. Currently, it supports 
    downloading building data from Google Open Buildings, with plans to extend 
    support for other providers in the future. Users can specify regions 
    of interest, and the package will handle the download and loading of spatial 
    data into an easily accessible GeoDataFrame format using 'sf'.
    The package is designed to be simple to use and highly extensible, 
    making it a useful tool for researchers, urban planners, and GIS professionals.
